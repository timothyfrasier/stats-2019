## HOMEWORK FOR REGRESSION WITH METRIC PREDICTED VARIABLE WITH ONE NOMINAL PREDICTOR VARIABLE

The model that we built in class assumed that the standard deviations were the same across levels within our nominal predictor variable (i.e., we estimated one sigma distribution). **Your homework is to modify the model (and anything else necessary) so that it will estimate a different standard deviation (sigma) for each level of the variable.** For this assignment you should analyze the **milk** data set.

You should turn in two files:
1. A file with the necessary code. This should include **all** aspects of the analyses (reading in the data, plotting it, etc.), but does not need to include all of the code used in class (streamline in to be what you want). The code should include all steps, from reading in the data file, to performing a posterior predictive check. It should also include a plot comparing the standard deviation estimates across the different levels.

2. A document (Word, Pages, txt, etc.) explaining:    
    **a.** What changes you made to the code, and why those changes were needed to do that you want    
    **b.** Your conclusions about whether or not you think it was necessary to estimate a different standard deviation for each level and why.

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you need any help!
