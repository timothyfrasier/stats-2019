## HOMEWORK FOR BINOMIAL MODELS

In class (and in the example code) we used a uniform prior for the parameter that we were estimating (theta, the probability of "success"). This is not likely the best choice, primarily because the true probability of an adult female right whale giving birth within a five year period is not likely zero or 1 (0 is definitely impossible, 1 is close to impossible).

For your homework, choose a different prior that is more appropriate. Justify the use of this prior, and then compare how your new model performs relative to our original one. Note that you estimates will likely be the same, however you should see some differences in the effective sample sizes (at least).
