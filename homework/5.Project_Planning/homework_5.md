## HOMEWORK FOR PROJECT PLANNING (14-MAR-2019)

Your homework for this week is to:    
1. Identify the structure of the data you will analyze for your final project. Again, this could be data you have already, or could represent some hypothetical data that you hope to have in the future. This includes:    
    **a.** What is your predicted variable, and what type is it (metric, nominal, ordinal, etc.)?    
    **b.** What are your predictor variables and what type is each?    

2. E-mail me this information

3. Include in your E-mail whether or not you have these data, or if you will need me to simulate some for you.

That's it!
